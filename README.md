# Arabic-image-captioning
This project utilizes the 2017 COCO dataset to develop a model capable of generating Arabic descriptions for images. Leveraging transformer-based architectures, we aim to accurately translate visual content into coherent and contextually relevant Arabic text.
## 1-We translate captions into Arabic
## 2-preprocess the data
## 3-train the model using transformers
