# Arabic-image-captioning
This project utilizes the 2017 COCO dataset to develop a model capable of generating Arabic descriptions for images. Leveraging transformer-based architectures, we aim to accurately translate visual content into coherent and contextually relevant Arabic text, advancing the field of image captioning with a focus on the Arabic language.
